# {Class Name}

## About
Describe the basic functionality of the class.

## Dependencies
Mention any third party libraries or Matlab toolboxes that do not come with the base package of Matlab but required for the functionality of the class.

## Features
**IMPORTANT!** _I think it is unnecessary to describe each function here. instead use the function 'help' feature to disclose the information below. Instead under this topic, you can briefly describe the features of the class i.e., functionality of important methods for the user to get an overview. Click [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/add-help-for-your-program.html) to find out more about function 'help' feature in Matlab._ 

Describe the methods (functions) available for the user. Follow the example below created using the [Sine](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sin.html) function in Matlab.
- ### Sine():
  #### Syntax
    Y = sin(X)
  #### Description
    Returns the sine of the elements of X. The sin function operates element-wise on arrays. The function accepts both real and complex inputs.
  #### Inputs
    | Name | Input Type | Data Type | Range | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | X | scalar,vector,matrix,multidimensional array,table,timetable | single,double,table,timetable | N/A | Input angle in radians|
  #### Outputs
    | Name | Input Type | Data Type | Range | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Y | scalar,vector,matrix,multidimensional array,table,timetable | N/A | N/A | Sine of input angle |
