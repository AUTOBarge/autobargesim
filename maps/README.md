# Maps Module

## About
 This code will help you separate the .shp part you want from the .000 file, and assist you in calling and visualizing the .shp in Matlab. 
 
 Additionally, users can customize the initial and end points of the route, and the algorithm can help automatically generate waypoints.
 
 Create the ENC map you need in MATLAB for easy Autobarge simulation!

Since Matlab can't directly read and modify .000 files, this method is used to display them in Matlab
- You can use 0002shp.py to batch extract .shp files
- You can use the code from shaperead_demo to select the area and features you want to visualize the .shp files, and process the point, line, and polygon in the .shp

They are two different functional codes, please review their readme and use them separately.
